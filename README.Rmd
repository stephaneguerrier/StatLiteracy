Welcome to the course on **Introduction to Statistical Literacy** (taught by [Stéphane Guerrier](https://stephaneguerrier.com/)) given within the course *Comprendre le numérique* at the University of Geneva.

# Slides

The linked slides (below) are `.html` files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid, grab the PDFs. You'll miss out on gifs and videos, but the rest will actually show up. These slides were prepared with the help of Prof. [Maria-Pia Victoria-Feser](), Prof. [Roberto Molinari]() and [Yuming Zhang]().

*Note:* The slides were created with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org) and the [template]() is based on the work of Dr. [Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in))
