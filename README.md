The linked slides (below) are `.html` files that will only work properly
if you are connected to the internet. If youâ€™re going off grid, grab the
PDFs. Youâ€™ll miss out on gifs and videos, but the rest will actually
show up. These slides were prepared with the help of Prof.Â [Maria-Pia
Victoria-Feser](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/faculty/all/maria-pia-victoria-feser/),
Prof.Â [Roberto Molinari](https://github.com/robertomolinari) and [Yuming
Zhang](https://github.com/Yuming-Zhang).

*Note:* The slides were created with

[R](cran.r-project.org) and the
[template](https://github.com/edrubin/EC607S20) is based on the work of
